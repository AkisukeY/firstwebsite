<h1>10 Questions About The Dataset</h1>

<p>
<u>What is the dataset?</u><br>
The dataset is about the dwelling structure by household composition and family composition meaning the data shows what type of houses people are living in and who are living in those houses, for example separate house, flat or apartment, two or three stories house, with or without children, single or couples.<br><br>

<u>Why is the dataset collected?</u><br>
This data is collected in order to gain a better understanding of the progress of NSW's demographic and can provide insight on the locations of specific issues, or interesting patterns within an area. The dataset can also show the distribution of the types of families living in certain conditions or the amount of types of dwellings which may be useful to the government.<br><br>

<u>Which government department do you think will use this and give evidence?</u><br>
The Department of Environment and Energy may use this data in order to gain insight to the status of the environment within a certain area, suburbs of high rise apartments will have much higher energy usage compared to a separate household and entire neighbourhoods can be assessed by the data given in terms of who is using the energy and in direct contact with the environment.<br><br>
The Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development will find this data pivotal in their work as they may use this data to reflect on their plans and gain an understanding of who they are dealing with when they decide to develop a new area. Areas with couples with children in houses may need certain roads to be open to ensure an easy way to school and work, making the department have to consider alternate routes before beginning development.<br><br>
As a result this data may very well be used for creating new laws in NSW in regards to aspects such as energy usage where restrictions may be placed in order to reduce the amount in which is being used by the population or to identify regions where it is optimal for development as the area can be self-sustained after it is completed.<br><br>

<u>Which private sector will use this and give evidence?</u><br>
Real Estate agencies may use this area to conduct professional explanations to potential buyers about a property as the buyer may feel more ensured that the property is going to fit their needs. Being able to see the general area of similar types of people as neighbours may make the buyer feel as if the property is the 'right one'. For example, a large area of singles in apartments are based in the CBD area.<br><br>

<u>How would this dataset change the way you think about space?</u><br>
This dataset has changed the way I see space by showing that certain spaces are naturally going to be populated by specific types of people or generally by a dominate factor, an example of this is the lack of separate houses within the city compared to flats and apartments or the increased occurrences of more than one storey houses within northern Sydney. This means that space is typically dependent on certain factors that is determined by the pre-existing norm within a space, factors such as the general wealth of the population, family types and environmental conditions of the area.<br><br>

<u>How does this dataset change across Sydney?</u><br>
There are various changes within Sydney when looking into specific data. These changes show the distribution of the household and family composition and some regions have very obvious differences to others. The central CBD area is dominate by flats and apartments over any other dwelling type and interestingly enough are mostly occupied by lone person households, meanwhile In northern Sydney there is a large increase in households that have more than one stories with an equal distribution of families with and without children. Northern Sydney also has a higher count of lone person households due to the elderlies settling down in the area. The further west from the city, the more separate houses with families with children begin to appear. This can provide useful insight like the fact that property is cheaper in the west regions which is why families with children are more inclined to move there compared to the city<br><br>

<u>How does it relate to the latte line?</u><br>
The latte line clearly shows a difference in North Sydney compared to the other regions. There are higher occurrences of more than one storey dwellings and this means that the area is more wealthy as more of the population there can afford this type of household. Meanwhile slightly below North Sydney, the city region has high rising apartments and flats which once again is very expensive and can mean that the population can afford it. Below the latte line, separate houses become less extravagant and more ‘standardised’ and fit for a family that is planning to stay living in the area for years to come and is therefore much cheaper which attracts more families from the east<br><br>

<u>How has the dataset changed between 2011 and 2016?</u><br>
Due to an increasing population and want for people to live closer to the coast and city there has been a notable increase in flats and apartments in the neighbouring regions of the city. There is also an increase in lone person households which may relate to the slight increase of age before people get married within NSW from 2011 and 2016, however there has been no major change in the distribution of family households with and without children which could signal that some of the population are hesitant to move in with their partners<br><br>

<u>How is this dataset significate to people's lives?</u><br>
This dataset is significate as it provides information to people who want to get a better understanding of the whole of NSW region and may assist them in future decisions such as moving houses that could have consequences for years to come. It allows for an easy way to visually see information in which can be utilised by the government to either create change or to ensure that everything is currently as it should be. The population who are interested in this data may also use it to try and gain insight for example, if a couple with no children are looking for property, they may also see where other couples with no children are which can make them like they are not out of place<br><br>

<u>Would it be good for this data to change? If you wanted to change it, how would you change it?</u><br>
The data as it is fulfilling its job quite well and a change is not required. However if I was going to change it, I would also include the average income of the population of a region in order to further understand why certain regions have a more popular type of dwelling type or why a couple family chooses not to have children or how separate house rates are different to flats or apartment rates. This eliminates the need for assumptions and further research as the information for such a large factor is already given
