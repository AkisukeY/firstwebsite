<h1> Childless Families Across Sydney</h1>

This map displays the change of the amount of childless families living in attached households within NSW between 2011 and 2016, and where these families are concentrated. The colour scale from white to red describe the statistical change in the population of childless families, the more of a distinct red a region is signifying a larger increase. The X axis signifies the concentration of childless families, the greater proportion of childless families the higher the region is displayed.<br><br>
To clarify, a complication arose when comparing data from 2011 to 2016, the data did not align, the G39 category was not present in the 2011 datasheet. To solve this issue, similar data was sourced in 2011 through category B25 (family composition). However, this limited the full capabilities of analysis we could explore. Thus, in our comparative analysis it exclusively focuses on family compositions and not additionally in relation to their household composition.<br><br>
Our early research took us to analysing the different family compositions to household compositions across Sydney. This led us to the initially, straightforward findings; single, younger people lived in the city centre and close to train lines in apartments whilst families investing in children removed themselves to more rural/suburban areas in detached or semi-detached housing. Those few that still lived outside the city yet were alone tended to be retires who at this point in their lives were reduced to living with themselves. Thus, in actual fact, the city is a lonely place as it attracts large masses of younger people, without access to private transport (relying on public transport) that work in city offices<br><br>
Our main area of interest became families/couples without children. They appeared to be concentrated within the larger, more finically prosperous NSW cities, including Sydney, Newcastle, Wollongong, etc. This stayed within the boundaries of our hypothesis, families move outward to open spaces to raise children and thus families with a child or children will be rare anomalies within CBD’s (this was verified by our research). Childless families would thus stay in the city as they are incentivised by greater monetary gains and would be discouraged from having children due to the inconvenience.<br><br>
Finally, the first map produced explored the populations of childless families in flats/apartments across NSW compared to every other family composition and dwelling structure. We discovered from this that childless families were concentrated within highly urbanised areas. The second analysed 2011 and 2016 data for total childless families, the result for which showed an overall slight decrease in childless families, however with relation to the latte line the eastern suburbs saw an increase whilst the western saw a decrease.<br><br>
These results were tabulated into a single data visualisation, this one present on our website.<br>
The main observations from this data are:<br><br>
• That childless families can be attributed to socio-economic factors, in a simple context the latte line shows the distinction between cultural values. Western areas have greater rates of childbirth yet eastern areas have less, therefore wealth defiantly is the most predominate factor for affecting the decision to be a childless family<br><br>
• That childless families can represent where developing/growing cities are due to their concentration in those areas<br><br>
• That the increase in childless families in affluent areas can be attributed to aging marriage rates, second marriages (people in their 60s-80s remarrying) and families that preference careers over children<br><br>
• That due to Sydney city’s sheer size and density, the largest gathering of childless families are present within it<br><br>
• That the childless families fluctuate due to their limbo status between single and child bearing family status and thus people with this status do not remain as so for a long time
